# The Perceptron Algorithm (\**lightning strikes\**)

At [The University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en) I leveraged the [Perceptron Algorithm](https://medium.com/anubhav-shrimal/perceptron-algorithm-1b387058ecfb) to train a single neuron in a Neural Network on 5000 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits from the [MNIST Dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) to classify handwritten from digits 0 to 9 with 98% accuracy.
